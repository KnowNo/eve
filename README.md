  * Note: extern folder containing dependencies at  (temporary location).

2. Download and unzip in project root ('extern' folder should be a sibling of
'include' and 'src').

3. Open a prompt in the root folder and run
  
  extern/bin/premake4.exe vs2012

  to generate the Visual Studio 2012 (November CTP) solution. Type "gmake"
  instead of "vs2012" to generate a GNU makefile instead.
